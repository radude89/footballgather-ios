FootballGather is a demo project for friends to get together and play football matches as quick as possible.
My intention is to to try out different iOS Architecture Patterns and use server side Swift (Vapor this time).
I used Balsamiq for creating mockups for the screens.

This repo contains the iOS App logic. For the server side version, please check <a href="https://github.com/radude89/footballgather-ws" target="_blank">Football Gather - Server Side</a>.

## Features
* Ability to add players
